# ðŸ“¦ push_swap â€“ Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (42 School Project)
![42 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/42-PushSwap-blue)

*A 42 School algorithm project focused on sorting data using a limited set of stack operations. The goal is to sort integers with the fewest possible moves.*

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

**push_swap** is a program that sorts a stack of integers using two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a limited set of operations. It outputs the list of instructions needed to sort the stack efficiently.

This project emphasizes algorithmic optimization, performance analysis, and efficient use of data structures.

## ðŸ“š Features

- Handles sorting of any number of integers (within `int` range).
- Implements and optimizes:
  - `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: swap the first two elements.
  - `pa`, `pb`: push the top element from one stack to the other.
  - `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: rotate stack up by one.
  - `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: rotate stack down by one.
